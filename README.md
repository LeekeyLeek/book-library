This is a library project I'm using to practice Object Oriented programming. The purpose of the program is to add any amount of books that you've read, or still need to read, so you can have a log of the books you've completed or would like to complete.

To use it, Click on the "New Book" button and fill out the form details. Once every text field has an entry, click submit to create your book listing.

If you would like to mark a book as read, you can do that by clicking the "Read" button on the book.

To delete a book from your library, click the "Delete" button on the book.
